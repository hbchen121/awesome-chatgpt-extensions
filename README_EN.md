# Awesome-ChatGPT-Extensions

**I'm "Chen Chengnan", collecting useful ChatGPT browser extensions and sharing them with everyone. Welcome to contribute!**

Currently, there are many plugins and application products available for ChatGPT, but a large portion of them require payment, have limited free usage, or require an OPENAI API KEY (which is equivalent to payment).

However, for OpenAI's official web version of ChatGPT (3.5-turbo), it is actually free, and only the API interface or GPT-4 requires payment. Therefore, following the principle of maximizing the free usage, this article aims to share some ChatGPT browser extensions that can be used based on the web version of ChatGPT. These extensions maximize the capabilities of ChatGPT at the lowest price (which is actually free), providing maximum efficiency and effectiveness.

Note: Some recommended browser extensions not only work with ChatGPT but also with Claude, Bard, and others for free. Additionally, the term "free" here refers to having the corresponding account, utilizing the free eligibility of your account to enhance the capabilities through the extensions.

## KeepChatGPT

First and foremost, I recommend KeepChatGPT because when using ChatGPT, it occasionally disconnects and requires constant refreshing. KeepChatGPT can avoid this issue, eliminating the hassle of refreshing.

> KeepChatGPT is an open-source, free, and efficient ChatGPT chatting extension that makes your conversations incredibly smooth. It eliminates various errors and warnings, saving you over 10 unnecessary steps and freeing your hands from refreshing the webpage. The author also continues to update and enhance its features, including disabling audits, cloning conversations, purifying the page, displaying in full screen, endless conversations, intercepting tracking, and constantly adding more.

## WebChatGPT

Since ChatGPT's knowledge is limited to data up to 2021, the answers it provides are outdated for anything that happened afterward. However, WebChatGPT helps overcome this limitation.

WebChatGPT combines web searching with ChatGPT by sending the search results along with the question to ChatGPT, enabling it to be aware of the latest information available on the web.

> Enhance your ChatGPT prompts with relevant web search results through web browsing. This free extension adds relevant web results to your prompts for ChatGPT, providing more accurate and up-to-date conversations.

> Key Features: ➡️ Get web results for your queries ➡️ Extract web page text from any URL ➡️ Add and use prompt templates Why You Need WebChatGPT: It is similar to the web browsing feature introduced by OpenAI for ChatGPT Plus users, allowing your ChatGPT to access the internet and provide accurate results and source links. But it's faster, lighter, and works for all ChatGPT users - free and enhanced versions!

Note: WebChatGPT is embedded within the ChatGPT page and may conflict with other embedded extensions like KeepChatGPT, resulting in the error message "An error occurred - Failed to fetch. You can check the console for more details. (Ctrl+Shift+J)".

## ChatGPT for Google

While conducting a Google search, simultaneously use ChatGPT to inquire about the search content and receive responses on the right side of the browser.

> The "ChatGPT for Google" extension displays ChatGPT's answers alongside Google search results. To use this extension, you need to be logged into OpenAI and configure relevant settings. Afterward, you can directly engage in conversations with ChatGPT on Google search result pages.
